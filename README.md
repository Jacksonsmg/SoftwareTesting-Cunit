## Introduction

Software testing is a crucial part of software development. It ensures that applications work as intended and meet user requirements. This repository serves as a guide and a toolkit for developers looking to implement unit testing in C++.

## Features

- **C++ Unit Testing**: Built on the CUnit framework for efficient unit testing.
- **Input Space Partitioning**: Divide input data into partitions to minimize test cases while maximizing coverage.
- **Edge Pair Coverage**: Enhance testing by ensuring all pairs of edges in the control flow graph are executed.
- **Control Flow Graphs**: Visualize and analyze the flow of control in your code.
- **Eclipse Integration**: Set up and run tests seamlessly within the Eclipse IDE.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jacksonsmg/SoftwareTesting-Cunit.git
   ```

2. **Open Eclipse**:
   Launch the Eclipse IDE and import the cloned project.

3. **Install CUnit**:
   Ensure you have CUnit installed. You can download it from [CUnit's official site](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/).

4. **Configure Build Path**:
   Set up the project‚Äôs build path to include CUnit libraries.

5. **Run Tests**:
   You can run tests directly from Eclipse after configuration.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start writing your test cases. The structure is designed to facilitate easy addition and modification of tests.

1. **Create Test Cases**:
   Use the provided templates to create new test cases. Ensure you cover various input scenarios.

2. **Run Tests**:
   Execute your tests within Eclipse. Check the console for results.

3. **Review Results**:
   Analyze the output to identify any failures or issues.

## Testing Techniques

### Input Space Partitioning

Input Space Partitioning (ISP) helps reduce the number of test cases while maintaining coverage. By dividing inputs into valid and invalid partitions, you can select representative test cases from each.

- **Valid Input**: Test with inputs that the system should accept.
- **Invalid Input**: Test with inputs that the system should reject.

### Edge Pair Coverage

Edge Pair Coverage ensures that all pairs of edges in the control flow graph are executed. This technique helps identify potential issues in the flow of the program.

- **Benefits**: Improves the likelihood of finding errors related to the flow of execution.

### Control Flow Graphs

Control Flow Graphs (CFG) provide a visual representation of the flow of control within a program. This helps in understanding complex logic and identifying paths that require testing.

- **Nodes**: Represent basic blocks of code.
- **Edges**: Represent the flow of control between these blocks.
